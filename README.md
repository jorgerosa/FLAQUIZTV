- What this app does?
- The main idea is to create a didactic simple/cute/fun quiz show game for all people and for all ages with that "TV show feeling" - A game for all family.

==============================================================================================
- Usage example:
- Parents: Edit the "XML" file (using "notepad") add your own questions and answers there (use your native idiom), related to school stuff, and let your kids play (learn) the game!

==============================================================================================
- Develop info:
- The game is developed in FLASH (AS2) and its very customizable.
- Since its developed in FLASH, you may play it in your PC or embed it in your webpage.

==============================================================================================
- TO-DO tasks:
- 1) Add support for ALL idioms (if possible).
- 2) Convert to AS3 (ActionScript 3).
- 3) Clean and optimize the code.
- 4) Remove all the bugs, for a stable V.1.0
